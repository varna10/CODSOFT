🎬📊 ML Projects: Movie Genre Classification, Customer Churn Prediction & Spam SMS Detection
📌 Overview
This repository contains three machine learning projects that tackle real-world problems using different classification techniques:

Movie Genre Classification – Predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary.
Customer Churn Prediction – Identifies customers likely to leave a subscription-based service.
Spam SMS Detection – Classifies SMS messages as spam or legitimate.
Each project includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation using suitable ML algorithms.

📂 Projects
1️⃣ Movie Genre Classification 🎥
Objective: Predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary.
Techniques Used:

Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
Feature extraction using TF-IDF or word embeddings
Classification using Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
📌 Dataset: Movie plot summaries from publicly available sources.https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb

📌 Usage:
Run movie_genre_classification.py to train and test the model.

2️⃣ Customer Churn Prediction 📉
Objective: Predict whether a customer will churn (leave a subscription-based service).
Techniques Used:

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature scaling)
Machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall
📌 Dataset: Customer usage and demographic data. "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/bank-customer-churn-prediction"

📌 Usage:
Run customer_churn_prediction.py to train and evaluate the model.

3️⃣ Spam SMS Detection ✉️
Objective: Identify spam messages using natural language processing (NLP).
Techniques Used:

Text preprocessing (removing special characters, stopwords, stemming)
Feature extraction using TF-IDF or word embeddings
Classification using Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM
Model evaluation using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score
📌 Dataset: SMS messages labeled as spam or ham (legitimate). https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset

📌 Usage:
Run spam_sms_detection.py to classify SMS messages.

📌 Results
Each model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, and the results are provided in the respective project folders.
